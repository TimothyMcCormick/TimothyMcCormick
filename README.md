### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Beginning with "Hello World" in Python, I knew I wanted to pursue a career in software development. As time went by at my job, I researched learning opportunities while dabbling in coding. Eventually I found Boise CodeWorks, who has been crucial in my learning process. I am currently looking for work and continuing to practice what I learned from CodeWorks (soon to be updated with "Working at ..'Some Awesome Company'..ðŸ˜Ž"). I love problem solving and the amazing feeling that comes with finding solutions (as long as that may take!) 

### My Skills: 

HTML & CSS, JavaScript ES6, Web API / HTTP, JS Frameworks, Nodejs, DotNet Core C#, Python, C++, SQL, MongoDb and Agile / Scrum.

### Some things that I enjoy...

-Playing drums and some guitar.

-Snowboarding

-Traveling with my family in our camper trailer

-Dirtbiking/Mountian Biking/BMX (Anything with 2 wheels really!)

-Drones (FPV and NonFPV)
